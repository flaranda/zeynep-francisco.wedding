    "text": "<b>Everything started in Germany</b>. Zeynep had moved there from Turkey to work in a town near Berlin, but after a while she settled in Nuremberg, and as luck would have it, she ended up sharing an apartment with Víctor, one of Fran's best friends.<br/><br/>One weekend, the two of us coincided at Víctor's birthday party. That's when we started talking, drinking together, and singing songs from our favorite bands on the karaoke machine. Neither of us knew that night was just the beginning.<br/><br/>Since then, we continued talking via WhatsApp, videocalling, and watching movies and series together online. Also, taking advantage of the fact that he was able to work remotely, Fran traveled to Germany very often, which helped to settle our relationship.<br/><br/>After some time, we made the decision to take the next step in our relationship, choosing Spain as our next home, and waiting to see what kind of adventures time and circumstances would bring us after our marriage.<br/><br/>What started as a simple night singing karaoke together has taken us all the way to our wedding day, which we can't wait to share with you all."
